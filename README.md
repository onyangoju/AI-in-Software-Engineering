## 🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)

### 1. Short Answer Questions
- **Q1:** Benefits and limitations of AI-driven code generation tools like GitHub Copilot.
- **Q2:** Comparison of supervised vs. unsupervised learning in bug detection.
- **Q3:** Importance of mitigating AI bias in personalized UX.

### 2. Case Study
- **Title:** *AI in DevOps: Automating Deployment Pipelines*
- **Focus:** Role of AIOps in enhancing software deployment efficiency with two real-world examples.

## 💻 Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)

### ✅ Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
- Used GitHub Copilot to auto-generate Python sorting logic.
- Compared with manually written version.
- Analysis included in `analysis.md`.

### ✅ Task 2: Automated Testing with AI
- Created Selenium IDE test for login flow (valid & invalid credentials).
- Captured output as `login_test_results.png`.
- Summary and script included in the task folder.

### ✅ Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
- Dataset: Kaggle Breast Cancer (used as proxy for issue severity prediction).
- Model: Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluation: Accuracy + F1 Score.
- Notebook: `predictive_model.ipynb`

---

## 🧭 Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)
Explores potential dataset bias in the predictive model and how fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 can detect and mitigate such bias.
