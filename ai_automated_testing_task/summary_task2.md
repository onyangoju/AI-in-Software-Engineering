This is a work of automation of tests of the login with valid and invalid credentials using Selenium IDE. Through its AI-based element selectors and self-healing locators, the test did not fail despite slight UI modifications. The test script was verified by making a successful authentication with a correct username and password, and an exception for invalid inputs. The results of both cases established correct system behavior. Unlike manual testing, the use of AI-powered testing tools, e.g., Selenium IDE or Testim.io, requires less effort as the tool detects the changes and adapts them automatically. This enhances the coverage of tests, which can be extrapolated through the quick generation of repetition test cases on various sets of inputs and user interface states. Also, the tools reduce the entry threshold of non-developers into the testing processes. The AI usage mechanism eventually enhances the testing process's effectiveness in terms of reliability and efficiency.
